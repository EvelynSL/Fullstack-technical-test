## Frontend – React + Vite
The frontend is a React-based web interface that connects to the FastAPI backend. It allows users to interact visually with the items API: displaying a list of items, adding new ones, editing existing ones, and deleting them. The UI is built with TailwindCSS for responsive design, and React Query is used for efficient data fetching and caching.
