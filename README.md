# Fullstack-technical-test

This project is a technical test that demonstrates the development of a fullstack web application using **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The goal is to implement a basic CRUD system for managing items, showcasing best practices in API design, frontend architecture, responsive UI with TailwindCSS, and data fetching using React Query.

The backend provides a simple RESTful API, while the frontend acts as the user interface to interact with that API.
